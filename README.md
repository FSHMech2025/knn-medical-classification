# Medical Disease Classification using KNN

This project implements a medical disease classification system using the
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The goal is to classify medical data
based on numerical features after proper preprocessing.

## Dataset
- Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset
- Source: scikit-learn built-in dataset

## Methodology
- Data loading and exploration
- Train-test split
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- KNN model training
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Results
- Accuracy: To be reported after experiments

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
